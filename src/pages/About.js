      <h2> Dictionary App</h2>
 <p> This is a Reactjs project focused on creating a simple, user-friendly design with seamless word-search functionality.
    This project was created for Junior Frontend Developer internship assessment at RaydainSoft. I learned so many new things by creating this coding project.
    I have thoroughly enjoyed building this dictionary app from scratch. This project was built with reactjs, bootstrap, css.
